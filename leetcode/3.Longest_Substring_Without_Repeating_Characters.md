Link to the problem: [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Get a string partition without any duplication
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Duplication judgement: set(s_partition) has the same length as len(s_partition). Right pointer starts from 1, so that there is always at least 1 character in s_partition;
- So long as there is no duplication, move the right pointer by 1. Check whether len(s_partition) is larger than the current max length;
- When duplication is detected, move the left pointer by 1;
- End of the loop: right pointer reaches the len(s). Python upper limit is NOT included!
# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(N)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

        if n == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            left, right = 0, 1
            while right <= n:
                if len(set(s[left: right])) == right - left:
                    max_length = max(max_length, right-left)
                    right += 1       
                else:
                    left += 1
                
                print(left, right, max_length)
            return max_length
